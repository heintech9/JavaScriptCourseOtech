 Task: Color Changer

Objective: Create a webpage where clicking on colored boxes changes their colors randomly. This will practice event handling and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

   - Give each `div` a class and an initial background color.

2. Add CSS:
   - Style the `div` elements to be 100px by 100px and displayed inline.
   - Add margin around each box for spacing.

3. JavaScript Functionality:
   - Write a function to generate random colors.
   - Add event listeners to each `div` to change its color when clicked.

4. Enhance with JavaScript:
   - Add a button to change the colors of all boxes to random colors when clicked.
